### Project Title
Bikeshare Analysis

### Description
The objective is to allow the user to explore Bikeshare data from various cities to draw their own conclusions based on the returned data.
On launch, the script loads Bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The user is then prompted to select which City to look at, which month and day of the week for which to pull data from.
The script then displays the following info from the data:
 * Time Stats - Most common month, most common day of the week, and most common start hour.
 * Station Stats - Most commonly used start station, most commonly used end station, and most common station combination to start and end at.
 * Trip Duration Stats - Total travel time and mean travel time across all entries.
 * User Stats - Total number of users, count of each gender, earlier birth year on record, most recent birth year on record, and most common birth year on record.

The user is then prompted with the option to redo their search with a new filter.
